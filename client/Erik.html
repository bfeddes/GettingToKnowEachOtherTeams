    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Erik. I've lived in the same general area of south and west of Chicago all my life. I like reading, music, movies, and video games. My family isn't too interesting, I think, beyond all of them living an alright life. The major I'm pursuing is Computer Science with a concentration in Video Game and Simulations.</p>

        <li>Serverless Computing</li>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">My Favorite Hobby</h3>
    <p>I guess I would say that my favorite hobby is video games. It started before I can rememebr, watching my dad play some puzzle games on PC. But I really started to get into gaming when he gave me a Gameboy Advance. Since then, some of my favorite series have been Pokemon, Guitar Hero, and Xenoblade. There are also two games in the indie scene that I would rate among my absolute favorites of all time, those being Cave Story and Hollow Knight.</p>
