            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>&emsp;My name is Brennan Price. I'm 22 years old, and I'm working towards a bachelor's degree in computer science with a minor in mathematics. I have concentrations in software engineering, game and simulation programing, and data science. I'm the middle child of five, and grew up on a small farm surrounded by animals. I have a small rascal of a cat named Spark, who I got from my girlfriend Lori's barn cats. As my studies indicate, I'm pretty introverted, but I enjoy spending time with my family and friends.</p>

            <h2>My Favorite Hobby:</h2>
            <p>&emsp;I have a few hobbies that I enjoy. While most of my spare time is spent on video games, I've also been enjoying 3D printing, as well as robotics. My introduction to computer science was through Arduino boards. Of my latest few projects, I'm most proud of a <a href="https://youtu.be/_-TvS3ePGz0">drone</a> controlled with the "force" like from Star Wars for a 4-H project.</p>
